        <h1>What We Do...</h1>
        <p>
            We run a Honda CBR600RR engine. Our Powertrain/Drivetrain system contains our intake manifold, exhaust, fuel system, fuel cell, dry sump oil system, electronic throttle, and pneumatic shifter. Our team designs and creates all of these components in house. We also tune the engine, electronic throttle, and pneumatic shifters using our chassis dynamometer.

                    Ben is a sophomore mechanical engineering major, he joined the team in Fall 2022. He was mentored by our previous powertrain lead (Chris Drake, Spring 2023). This season, Ben has worked on a complete redesign of the intake system, a motor rebuild, as well as the cooling and exhaust systems. He is also a member of our welding team and plays a huge role in chassis and accumulator fabrication.
