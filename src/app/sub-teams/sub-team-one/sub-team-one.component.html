        <h1>What We Do...</h1>
        <p>
            The subsystem works to design and manufacture aerodynamic components for the racecar. With the help of our sponsors, we can manufacture our aerodynamic package completely in house The package creates a downforce on the tires and in turn alters the maximum frictional force the carâ€™s tires can generate. Components include front and rear wings, an undertray, nosecone, and sidepods.

                    Abel is a senior mechanical engineering major. He joined 
                    the team in Fall 2020. He has dedicated his time to learning 
                    Star CCM software and creating simulations to design a more efficient 
                    aerodynamics package. Abel has redesigned our rear wing and 
                    sidepod/ducts. He also introduced the addition of Mylar to our carbon 
                    fiber manufacturing process improving the surface finish on our parts. 
                    While away on co-op at Hunter Engineering for Fall 2023, Abel is continuing 
                    his design process remotely and commuting in on weekends.
